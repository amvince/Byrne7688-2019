Our FRC Rookie year!

Going simple for our first year - Drivetrain, Arm that can "load" into position, and Pneumatic release.

Initially we were planning on having our Arm also help in the climb, but given we are a rookie team and have a lot to learn, we restricted ourselves to one task only.

See you in Victoria BC!
